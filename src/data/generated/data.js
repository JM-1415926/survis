    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a joint model for named entity recognition and relation extraction based on BERT, named BERT-BILSTM-LSTM. It improves upon the LSTM-LSTM-Bias model by incorporating contextualized embeddings via BERT, enabling better handling of polysemous words. The model achieves improved performance on both a standard dataset (NYT) and a newly constructed agricultural dataset (AgriRelation). Experimental results show that the model is effective on both large and small datasets, with significant gains in F1 score over baseline models.",
